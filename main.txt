●      Involved in the analysis, design, development and system integration and testing phases of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Gathered inputs from business and analyse the business requirements and provide possible solutions.
●      Incrementally refactor a monolithic application to migrate to Cloud base Spring Boot Microservices

●      Analyze existing functionalities to apply an appropriate pattern for microservices. ex - Strategy on transaction and failure, Deployment strategy to make it highly available and maintainable.

●      To achieve consistency between Microservices use Event-driven Architecture and distributed Message broker (Kafka) for messaging.

●      Create the deployment strategy and build pipeline using Docker and Kubernetes.

●      Use Service-Discovery Spring-Eureka for inter-process communication  and Spring Config-server  to manage env Specific Configuration for Microservices


●      Support Production deployment activity and resolve production issues.
